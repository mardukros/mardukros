## Development Roadmaps

### ðŸš€ Strategic Implementation Plans

- **[Node-llama-cpp Integration Roadmap](development/node-llama-cpp-roadmap.md)**
  - Comprehensive development plan for local AI inference
  - Technical requirements and infrastructure changes
  - Implementation phases and migration strategy
  - Risk assessment and timeline with milestones

## Coding Standards

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Maintain high test coverage for new features
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Use meaningful commit messages

## Adding a New Feature

1. Determine which subsystem the feature belongs to
2. Create necessary interfaces in the appropriate types directory
3. Implement the feature in the appropriate subsystem
4. Add tests for the new functionality
5. Update documentation

## Memory Subsystem Development

When developing for the memory subsystem:

1. Extend the appropriate base classes
2. Implement required interfaces
3. Add validation for new memory types
4. Consider persistence implications
5. Add optimization strategies

## Task Subsystem Development

When developing for the task subsystem:

1. Define task types clearly
2. Implement validation rules
3. Consider task priority mechanisms
4. Handle task failures gracefully

## AI Subsystem Development

When developing for the AI subsystem:

1. Maintain provider-agnostic interfaces
2. Implement robust error handling
3. Optimize token usage
4. Consider context management carefully

## Autonomy Subsystem Development

When developing for the autonomy subsystem:

1. Define clear metrics for analysis
2. Implement safe optimization strategies
3. Add thorough validation
4. Consider potential side effects

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
